# TriCraft Handyman Services — Brand Guide

## Logo
The TriCraft logo features a house silhouette containing three trade tools — a hammer (carpentry), a wrench (plumbing), and a lightning bolt (electrical). This visually reinforces the "tri" in TriCraft and the core multi-trade value proposition.

### Color Rationale
- **Steel blue** conveys trust, professionalism, and reliability — the exact qualities a homeowner looks for in a contractor. It matches the existing logo color.
- **Burnt orange** for CTAs creates urgency and stands out against the blue palette — high contrast drives click-through.
- **Warm gold** adds a premium touch without feeling flashy — perfect for trust signals and ratings.

## Typography

| Usage | Font | Weight | Source |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Headings | Bitter | 600–700 | Google Fonts |
| Body | Source Sans 3 | 400–600 | Google Fonts |

### Why These Fonts
- **Bitter** is a slab serif with a sturdy, craftsman quality — it feels like the kind of type you'd see on a quality tool brand or a well-made sign. It has personality without being trendy.
- **Source Sans 3** is clean, highly readable, and pairs naturally with Bitter. It has excellent weight coverage for hierarchy.

## Voice & Tone
Straightforward and confident without being boastful. Speaks like a skilled neighbor who does quality work and treats people fairly — no corporate jargon, no sales pressure, no fluff.

## Design Principles
1. **Show real work** — Client photos over stock images, always
2. **One call, one contractor** — Reinforce the multi-trade differentiator everywhere
3. **Honest and direct** — No filler copy, no "in today's fast-paced world"
4. **Local pride** — Ephrata and Lancaster County are part of the brand identity
5. **Clean and professional** — The site should look better than every local competitor while feeling approachable
