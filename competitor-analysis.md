## Competitor Overview

| Business | Website | Design (1-5) | SEO (1-5) | Content (1-5) | Key Weakness |
|----------|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|--------------|
| Ace Handyman Services Lancaster | acehandymanservices.com/lancaster | 3 | 4 | 3 | Franchise template, no local personality |
| Mr. Handyman of Lancaster | mrhandyman.com/lancaster | 3 | 3 | 2 | National chain template, generic copy |
| Local independent handymen | Facebook/Yelp only | 1 | 1 | 1 | No website at all — just social profiles |

## Key Findings

### What competitors are doing:
- National franchises (Ace, Mr. Handyman) have template sites with decent SEO but zero local character
- Most independent handymen in Ephrata have NO website — just a Facebook page or Yelp listing
- Larger companies (Haller) focus on HVAC/plumbing and don't emphasize multi-trade capability
- Almost nobody has real project photos — they all use stock images

### Top 3 Keyword Opportunities They're Missing:
1. **"handyman Ephrata PA"** — No local business owns this search with a dedicated, optimized page
2. **Multi-trade combination keywords** — "plumber and electrician Ephrata" / "one contractor for plumbing and electrical" — nobody targets these
3. **Specific service + location long-tails** — "water heater installation Ephrata PA", "door replacement Lancaster County" — wide open

### Design & UX Gaps We Exploit:
- **Real work photos**: Nobody has a gallery of actual completed projects. Stock photos everywhere.
- **Page speed**: Franchise sites are bloated (4-6s load times). Our static Next.js site loads in <1s.
- **FAQ section with schema**: No competitor has FAQ rich snippets. This is free SERP real estate.
- **Service area content**: Nobody lists specific towns beyond Lancaster city. Targeting 28 towns = 28 keyword opportunities.
- **Mobile experience**: Most competitor sites have mediocre mobile layouts. Ours is mobile-first.

### The #1 Thing We Do That NONE of Them Do:
**Combine a premium, agency-quality design with hyper-local SEO targeting AND real project photography.** Every competitor is either (a) a franchise template with no soul, (b) a large company that treats handyman services as a side note, or (c) has no website at all. TriCraft's site will be the only one that looks custom-built, ranks for Ephrata-specific searches, AND shows actual work from the community.
