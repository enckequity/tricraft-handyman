## Key Findings

### 1. NONE of these competitors offer online booking
Every single competitor forces customers to call during business hours or fill out a contact form and wait. In 2026, this is a massive gap.

### 2. Most competitors have weak or nonexistent content strategies
Only 2 of 13 (Lamonts and McLennan) have medium-high content depth. Zero have an active blog. Long-tail SEO is completely untapped.

### 3. Ephrata-specific competition is especially weak
Businesses physically based in Ephrata (Horton's, James Morrow, Husband For A Day) have the weakest digital presence. Horton's has no website at all.

### 4. Design quality averages around 3/5
Most sites look 3-7 years old. Only McLennan approaches modern standards, but they actively limit handyman clients.

## Top 3 Keyword Opportunities They're ALL Missing

### 1. "Emergency handyman Ephrata PA" / "same-day handyman Lancaster County"
No competitor targets emergency or same-day service keywords. High-intent, high-conversion traffic left on the table.

### 2. "Handyman prices Ephrata PA" / "handyman cost Lancaster PA"
Not a single competitor publishes pricing information. Zero transparency in this market.

### 3. Long-tail service + location combinations
Nobody creates dedicated content for "drywall repair Ephrata PA", "ceiling fan installation Lancaster County", "deck repair near Ephrata", etc. These have low competition and high purchase intent.

## The #1 Thing We Do That NONE of Them Do

**Combine a premium, agency-quality design with hyper-local SEO targeting AND real project photography.**

Every competitor is either:
- (a) a franchise template with no local soul
- (b) a large company that treats handyman services as an afterthought
- (c) a dated Wix/template site with thin content
- (d) has no website at all

TriCraft's site is the only one that looks custom-built, ranks for Ephrata-specific searches, includes FAQPage schema for rich snippets, targets 28 individual towns, AND showcases actual completed work from the community. Combined with sub-1-second page load (vs. 3-6 seconds for competitors), this creates an objectively superior digital presence that should dominate local search.
